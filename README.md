### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alex. I am a full stack web developer with an interest in new product and market development.

I've spent most of this past year studying full stack web development at [Lambda School](https://www.lambdaschool.com), an immersive 6-month coding bootcamp, where I've learned frontend development, complex state management, API development, backend development, and computer science, among other topics.

Prior to becoming a web developer, I rose through the ranks as a sales and partnerships manager at [Guideline](https://www.guideline.com), a top-tier fintech startup based in the Bay Area, where I got my first taste of software development and ultimately decided to pursue it as a career.
